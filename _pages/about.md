# About me #

I am Assistant Professor at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Department of Mathematics.

Until March 2024 I was a PostDoc researcher at Charles University, Faculty of mathematics and physics, in Prague. 
Where I worked together with Stefano Pozza on a <a href="https://www.starlanczos.cz/the-project">project</a> to develop a new numerical method for solving time-dependent non-autonomous ordinary differential equations.

I received my PhD at KU Leuven under the supervision of Marc Van Barel and Raf Vandebril.

# Research interests #

* Structured matrices in (bi)orthogonal Krylov subspace methods
* Orthogonal polynomials and rational functions
* Spectral methods
* Quantum Krylov methods
