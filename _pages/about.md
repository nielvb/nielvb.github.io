# About me #

I am a PostDoc researcher at Charles university, Faculty of mathematics and physics, in Prague. 
My research focusses on structured matrices in the context of rational Krylov subspaces.
The study of these matrices can be used to develop numerically stable algorithms for a variety of problems in mathematics.


# Research interests #

* Structured matrices
* Orthogonal polynomials
* Short recurrence relations
* Spectral methods
* Biorthogonal Krylov subspace methods
